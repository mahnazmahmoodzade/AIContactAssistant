## Key Features

### ✅ Clean Architecture
- **Separation of Concerns**: Each service has a single responsibility
- **Dependency Injection**: Proper DI container usage throughout
- **Configuration Management**: Centralized configuration with fallbacks
- **Logging**: Structured logging with different levels

### ✅ Semantic Kernel Integration
- **17 Plugin Registration**: All contact assistant plugins automatically registered
- **Background Services**: Proper service lifecycle management
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling and logging

### ✅ Production Ready
- **Configuration**: Support for both OpenAI and Azure OpenAI
- **Service Management**: Proper startup/shutdown handling
- **Extensibility**: Easy to add new plugins and services

## Configuration

Set your API key in one of these ways:

1. **appsettings.json**:
```json
{
  "OpenAI": {
    "ApiKey": "your-api-key-here"
  }
}
```

2. **Environment Variable**:
```
OPENAI_API_KEY=your-api-key-here
```

## Running the Application

```bash
dotnet run
```

The application will:
1. Register all 17 plugins with dependency injection
2. Initialize Semantic Kernel with proper configuration
3. Demonstrate plugin functionality
4. Run as a background service

## Key Improvements Made

### 🔧 Code Organization
- Moved services to separate files in `Services/` folder
- Separated concerns into logical methods
- Added proper error handling and logging
- Improved naming conventions

### 🏗️ Architecture
- Clean host builder pattern
- Proper service registration order
- Configuration-driven setup
- Better separation of concerns

### 📝 Documentation
- Added comprehensive comments
- Documented service responsibilities
- Clear method and class naming
- Structured README

## Next Steps

To extend this application:

1. **Add new plugins**: Create new plugin classes and register them in `SemanticKernelExtensions.cs`
2. **Add API endpoints**: Consider adding a web API layer for external access
3. **Add persistence**: Integrate with databases for conversation history
4. **Add monitoring**: Add application performance monitoring and health checks
