# AIContactAssistant
The assistant sits on the telecom’s “Contact Us” page and handles both sales and support intents end-to-end—no traditional form. It verifies identity (when needed), retrieves knowledge, updates systems, and books actions. It must operate under strict PII controls, consent logging, and human handoff.
